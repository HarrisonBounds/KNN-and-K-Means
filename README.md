# MSAI349 Machine Learning: Homework 2
To run our unit tests and see the results, please run the following:

```bash
pytest -s
```

The distance metrics (`distance_metrics.py`) we implemented are:
- Euclidean Distance
- Hamming Distance
- Pearson Correlation
- Cosine Similarity


The K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm (`k_nearest_neighbors.py`) can be run on the MNIST dataset, which will generate the confusion matrices of the results and display the metrics of the results such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The K-Means Clustering algorithm (`k_means_clustering.py`) can be run on the MNIST dataset and have its metrics displayed.

The Collaborative filtering algorithm (`collab_filter.py`) can be run on the MovieLens dataset and display movie reccommendations and metrics about the results.
