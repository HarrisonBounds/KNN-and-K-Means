Answers:

Part I:

2A. Please describe all of your design choices and hyper-parameter selections in a paragraph.

We got satfactory results with K as 5, and distance metric as euclidean, even without dimentionality reduction.

2B. Once you are satisfied with the performance on the validation set, run your classifier on the test set 
and summarize results in a 10x10 confusion matrix for each distance metric. Analyze your results in another paragraph.

The results observed for the mnist testing dataset(mnist_test.csv) upon KNN classification :
Accuracy: 0.9800000000000001
Precision: 0.9025205627705628
Recall: 0.8905366767735188
F1_score: 0.8900603439819568

# Add SS of confusion matrix for each of the 10 label.
# Add the heatmap.

3A. Present a quantitative metric to measure how well your clusters align with the
labels in mnist_test.csv. 

3B. Describe your design choices and analyze your results in about
one paragraph each.


Part II:

4A. Please describe how your collaborative filter works.

4B. List the hyper-parameters and describe their role. 

4C. Report precision, recall, and the F1-score on the validation and test sets for users a, b, and c. Discuss how M impacts your results.

5A. Report precision, recall, and the F1-score on the validation and test sets for users a, b, and c. Discuss your
approach and whether or not considering additional features improved the performance of your collaborative filter.
